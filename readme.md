## Project Abstract
A smart contract abstracted wallet that allows user more control over fund movement and core functionality with restricted permission to DApps and functionality extension plugings. This means you can accomplish 2 major tasks using our SC wallet:
1. Define how DApps can interact with funds (ETH) in your wallet using custom permissions
2. Extend wallet functionality by adding in new `facets` to extend it's core application.

We aim to provide a way to users to build their ideal wallet starting with our SC wallet and framework and for developers to be able to customise user experiences tailor-made for their applications.

## Objectives
With this grant we are hoping to finish up with MVP for the project, this includes:
1. Safe and Well Tested Core Framework
2. Core Facets to plug into the Framework
3. Developer SDKs and plugins

Along with core services like transaction automations, gas relayers and more that work in tandem with the core wallet to provide extended functionality to the users.

## Outcomes
We hope to build a standard for plugin based smart contract wallets that can allow for custom wallet experiences without the need to build custom wallets. We aim to provide higher level of control to the users without compromising base security of their wallets.

## Grant Scope
We are going to work on merging eip-2535 functionality with eip-4337 to allow for customizable smart contract wallets along with user permission system.
